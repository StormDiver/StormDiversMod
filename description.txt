[c/22DD97:Storm's Additions Mod] (Formerly Storm Diver’s Additions Mod), is a decently sized content mod that adds unique content throughout different areas of the game where content seems lacking, along with unique items thrown in here and there. It even makes some hard to obtain vanilla items a little easier to get.

There's over 300 total modded items for you to discover; including weapons, accessories, ammo, tools, armour, vanity sets, enemies, and more. Many are crafted with vanilla items, but some have their own modded ingredients added to the recipes.

This mod includes:

-Over 100 new unique weapons across all classes, including some minions and sentries
-Over 30 new accessories, including new expert exclusive ones and some tinkers
-11 new armour sets with unique set bonuses
-Many new ammos including unique ammo for certain weapons
-Multiple new tools
-New bars and other crafting materials
-A bunch of different buffs and debuffs inflicted from a range of sources
-10 new potions
-5 new Vanity sets and a 2 special vanity masks
-4 new pets
-25 new enemies across the game, most with their own banner
-1 new unique boss that can be fought in place of the Plantera (config option)
-New recipes for certain uncraftable vanilla items

Please note that if you previously used the 1.3 version of the mod and import that 1.3 world/character you will lose any of this mod’s items obtained due to an internal name change and file renaming! If this is the case it is highly recommended to start a brand new playthrough.
