[b]Storm's Additions Mod[/b] (Formerly Storm Diver’s Additions Mod) is a small-medium sized content/Minor QoL mod that adds unique content throughout different areas of the game where content seems lacking, along with unique items thrown in here and there. It even makes some hard to obtain vanilla items a little easier to get.

There's over 300 total modded items for you to discover; including weapons, accessories, ammo, tools, armour, vanity sets, enemies, and more. Many are crafted with vanilla items, but some have their own modded ingredients added to the recipes.

Please note that if you previously used the 1.3 version of the mod and import that 1.3 world/character you will lose any of this mod’s items obtained due to an internal name change and file renaming! If this is the case it is highly recommended to start a brand new playthrough.
